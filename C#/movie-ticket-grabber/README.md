# movie-ticket-grabber
A fun hack project to get notified when your upcoming favorite movie tickets go live.

This was created to get notified by email when tickets are on sale for my much anticiapted favorite movie Baahubali-2.

Build and run this exe in task scheduler to get notified. No more refreshing you browser for every one minute. 

No depenedency on web browser, so works even if someone accidentally closes your browser.

I used send sendgrid .net SDK for sending email, but this can be easily done via SMTP.

Have a look at app.config and change the values as per your setting.

PS: About Baahubali :)
